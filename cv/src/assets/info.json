  "welcoming_text": "I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I started my professional journey in the field of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Pattern Matching. However, my passion for programming and design soon led me towards front-end projects, where I focused on streamlining the CI/CD pipeline and improving the quality assurance processes. While working on the back-end development of software for the broadcasting industry, I realized my interest in minimal design and creating usable UIs for products, and then I moved into a front-end position. What motivates me is developing clean and reusable code, which results in high-quality software. My obsession leads me to turn every piece of code into a reusable and testable component, which helps in minimizing errors and reduces development time.",
